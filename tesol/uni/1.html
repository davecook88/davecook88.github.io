                <body class="c15"><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c9">English has no future tense, because it has no future tense inflections, in the way that<br>many other languages do, nor any other grammatical form or combination of forms<br>that can exclusively be called a future tense.<br>(Aarts, 2011: 244)2<br>Discuss, with illustrative examples, the view that &ldquo;English has no future tense&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c10 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c9">Introduction</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In pedagogic grammars, the ways in which future events are described in English has traditionally been described as a tense. In linguistic circles, this supposed truism has been the subject of much debate, however. Over the course of this essay, I will discuss proposals on this matter from several authors and compare their views to Aarts&rsquo;. We will consider the various periphrastic forms that exist in the English language to denote future events, their usages and the varying degrees to which they are interchangeable. I shall explore the extent to which structures indicating future events have become grammaticalized and the implication of this in terms of the greater debate. Finally I will introduce the concept of differing degrees of Future Tense Markers, as proposed by &Ouml;sten Dahl and the EUROTYP project, comparing many different language&rsquo;s grammatical interpretations of the future.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c10 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c9">2. Grammatical approaches to the future in English</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c10 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Many grammarians have taken the approach of describing the language using the terms of Latin grammar, in which inflectional forms of verbs exist in order to express aspects of time and mood, including the past, present and future. Due to the &ldquo;influence of the Latinate grammatical tradition&rdquo; equivalents to the Latin inflected forms were found in English and the traditional names applied to them (Chrystal, 2003: 196). Verbs in English remain comparatively static, inflecting only with the past tense through the addition of the bound morpheme </span><span class="c3">-ed </span><span>and related irregular forms to indicate the past. It has therefore been argued that the use of Latin&rsquo;s terminology to describe English is erroneous (</span><span>Aarts, 2011: 244)</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span class="c1">. Bergs (2010) adds that in the absence of a single morphemic transformation which can be applied to verbs as in Latin or Turkish, &ldquo;futurity in English is signalled by complex combinations of different elements and extralinguistic (pragmatic, contextual) factors&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>English grammar possesses a variety of grammatical forms for expressing future events. Collins Cobuild English Grammar (2005) states that the future constructions formed with the modal verb </span><span class="c3">will </span><span>may be used to show &ldquo;something is planned to happen or that you think is likely to happen&rdquo; (sentence 1), &ldquo;General truths&rdquo;(sentence 2), for &ldquo;Indicating certainty&rdquo; (sentence 3) and &ldquo;Indicating duration&rdquo; (sentence 4), whereas the construction </span><span class="c3">be going to + infinitive </span><span class="c1">should be used for events that &ldquo;will happen quite soon or if you are stating your intention that it will happen&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><ol class="c6 lst-kix_lv79k1n7f5y7-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 c7"><span class="c1">What will you do tomorrow?</span></li><li class="c0 c7"><span class="c1">If the price is low, people will buy it.</span></li><li class="c0 c7"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure he will come.</span></li><li class="c0 c7"><span class="c1">They will have been married for 40 years next month.</span></li></ol><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In sentences 1 and 3, the modal verb </span><span class="c3">will</span><span>&nbsp;could be substituted for the present continuous form of the verb without any loss of meaning whereas this would be ungrammatical in the cases of sentences 2 and 4 (see sentences 5 to 9). That there the use of a future marker is optional in some sentences appears to lend credence to the assertion that the use of </span><span class="c3">will</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is not a future tense but rather serves to convey a volitional meaning. The instances in which usage of a future marker is unavoidable seem to counter Aarts&rsquo;s claim. We will explore this issue in greater depth in section 4.</span></p><p class="c0 c5 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><ol class="c6 lst-kix_lv79k1n7f5y7-0" start="5"><li class="c0 c7"><span class="c1">What are you doing tomorrow?</span></li><li class="c0 c7"><span class="c1">*If the price is low, people are buying it.</span></li><li class="c0 c7"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m sure he is come.</span></li><li class="c0 c7"><span class="c1">*They are having been married for 40 years next month.</span></li></ol><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">2.2 </span><span class="c1">When making reference to scheduled events, English allows for the present tense to be used, as in sentence 9. Dahl (2000) notes that &ldquo;even for languages where future-time reference is otherwise highly grammaticalized&rdquo; the use of future markers is not required. As such, this treatment of future tense should not be used as an assertion that English lacks a future tense, when similar constructions are considered grammatical in languages which posses an inflected present tense, such as the Latin-derived romance languages (see sentence 10).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The train leaves at 9pm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. El tren sale a las 9. [Spanish]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="c3">Lit. </span><span class="c1">Train &nbsp; leavePRS on the 9</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Concerning Aarts&rsquo; (2011) assertion that &ldquo;no grammatical form or combination of forms&rdquo; in English serve only to portray the future seems to imply that other tenses in English also meet this criteria. This overlooks the variety of forms available to express the past, </span><span class="c3">preterite, perfect, past progressive </span><span>etc. along with the difference in meaning when using, for example, </span><span class="c3">simple present, </span><span>to express past actions, used to suggest a &ldquo;vivid narrative&rdquo; (Collins Cobuild English grammar, 2005: 257) or the </span><span class="c3">past</span><span>&nbsp;to show irrealis conditions (</span><span class="c3">If I had more money&hellip;)</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;among others. &ldquo;It thus seems somewhat infelicitous to assume (or rather demand) an isomorphic relationship for the future&rdquo; Bergs (2010).</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">3.1 The grammaticalization of </span><span class="c3 c9">going to, will </span><span class="c9">and </span><span class="c3 c9 c11">shall</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c11 c3 c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Chrystal (2003) agrees with Aarts&rsquo; suggestion that only inflection of the verb itself constitutes a tense in itself, however should it be the case that the periphrastic constructions in English have been completely grammaticalized and retain no semantic value, they could reasonably be considered to inhabit the same category as Latin&rsquo;s inflections. Aarts states that the use of will indicates &ldquo;dynamic modality&rdquo; in a &ldquo;predisposition on the referent of the subject&rdquo; or &ldquo;deontic modality&rdquo; signifying obligation (Aarts, 2011: 284-285). In many instances this is clearly true, particularly those cases in which the modal verb may not be substituted without affecting meaning.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c14"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>There is strong evidence to suggest that in many instances the use of </span><span class="c3">will</span><span>&nbsp;does not invoke a conditional mood, likewise there is no andative connotation in the use of </span><span class="c3">going to</span><span>. Often these verbs act simply as a grammatical marker and do not serve to add modality to the a clause&rsquo;s principal verb. While older grammars insist on using </span><span class="c3">will </span><span>and</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;going to</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in accordance with their original meanings (Poplack, 1999), we may conclude that contemporary English has developed from this point.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">3.2.1 </span><span class="c1">Sentences 11a and 11b indicate that the common contraction of &ldquo;going to&rdquo; to &ldquo;gonna&rdquo; in spoken and informal discourse is only applicable when referring to the future and is never applied to the andative usage of the form (Bergs, 2010). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11a. I&rsquo;m gonna get something to eat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11b. *I&rsquo;m gonna Paris</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">3.2.2 </span><span>This distinction serves to support the notion that </span><span class="c3">going to </span><span>has shed much of its original semantic value when used to indicate future events, Dahl (200: 314) suggests that &ldquo;the most salient parameter&rdquo; of grammaticalization is &ldquo;bound-ness&rdquo; in that bound morphemes, which lack any meaning in and of themselves, are more grammatical than words that on their own express semantic meaning. In this way, the contraction of the word </span><span class="c3">to </span><span>to what may be considered a bound morpheme </span><span class="c3">-na</span><span>&nbsp;signifies that, at least in colloquial discourse, this grammaticalization process is complete. The modal verbs </span><span class="c3">will </span><span>and </span><span class="c3">shall</span><span>&nbsp;may be considered to have progressed even further towards &ldquo;bound-ness&rdquo;. The contraction </span><span class="c3">&lsquo;ll</span><span>&nbsp;is &ldquo;almost ten times more frequent&rdquo; in corpora than </span><span class="c3">shall </span><span>and </span><span class="c3">will </span><span>(Carter, 2006: 650) and in many instances, it would be impossible to substitute the </span><span class="c3">&lsquo;ll </span><span>for either </span><span class="c3">shall </span><span>or </span><span class="c3">will</span><span>&nbsp;without the resulting utterance appearing unnatural (see sentences 12a-b). In the instances mentioned both </span><span class="c3">gonna</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3">&lsquo;ll </span><span>appear to have been sufficiently semantically depleted to be considered purely grammatical.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12a. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a garage. We</span><span class="c9">&rsquo;ll</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;just stop and get some petrol&rdquo; (ibid: 632)</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12b. </span><span class="c4">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a garage. We shall/will just stop and get some petrol&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(ibid.)</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The</span><span>&nbsp;use of the auxiliary verbs </span><span class="c3">will </span><span>or </span><span class="c3">going to </span><span class="c1">is unavoidable in many instances. If we are to assume that &ldquo;Languages differ essentially in what they must convey and not in what they may convey&rdquo; (Jakobson, 1956), then although English does not express the future tense by inflection, as in Latin and the Romance Languages, it must be considered as belonging to the same set of languages in that future-markers are mandated by its grammar, as opposed to languages such as Japanese, Mandarin or even German.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">3.3 </span><span>If we are to consider Latin as the benchmark for future tense, it is worth considering that the inflected form of Latin verbs to express the future itself evolved from periphrastic constructions with modal verbs. Indeed the use of the modal </span><span class="c9">habeo- </span><span>after an infinitive, expressed inevitability from the epistemic perspective of the speaker. Over time this became increasingly grammaticized until only the bound morphemes, corresponding to </span><span class="c9">habeo&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1">individual conjugations remained, which became affixed to the infinitive of the verbs that they modified (Valesio, 1968; Pinkster, 1985). It seems apparent that this process is underway or even complete in English.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c10">4.1 Future Time Markers</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may prove more helpful to consider the treatment of future events in different languages, not in binary terms whereby there exists a future tense or not, rather that there is a continuum along which languages require a more or less grammatical marker of the future to be employed. At the most grammatical extreme of this continuum would rest those languages in which the verb must take on an inflected form when expressing future actions. On the other extreme would be languages for which no future marker exists whatsoever. Among these languages we would find Japanese, in which there are only inflected verb forms for past and non-past and Mandarin. The EUROTYP project suggested the term Future Time Markers (FTM) to describe how different languages appear on the spectrum. Languages with inflected verb forms for the future tense would be described as having Strong FTR with languages such as Japanese and Mandarin having Weak FTR (Dahl, 2000). This continuum is visualised below.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">AnyGrFTR&sup;WeakFTR&sup;StrongFTR&sup;InflectionalFTR </span><span class="c1">(Chen, 2013:9)</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Aarts&rsquo;s assertion that English cannot be considered to possess a future tense indicates that only those languages sitting on the far right of the FTR spectrum would meet this criteria. While English verbs do not inflect to show the future, constructions such as </span><span class="c3">will</span><span>&nbsp;are unavoidable in certain instances (sentences 1-8), making English a StrongFTR language (Chen, 2013:8). To suggest that no future tense exists in English at all, would be to ignore this fact and to group English with all non-inflectional languages, which diverge significantly in their treatment of future events.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">4.2 </span><span class="c1">Studies have shown that speakers of weak-FTR languages exhibit behaviour tending toward delaying gratification such as saving a greater proportion of their income and lower patterns of smoking than their strong-FTR-language-speaking counterparts when controlled for external factors (Chen, 2013; Sutter, 2015). The hypothesis for this effect is that with a lesser grammatical distancing between the present and the future, the consequences of harmful behaviour will appear more immediate to the speakers of weak-FTR languages and, as a result, the individual is less inclined to engage in such acts. These findings appear to support the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which states that the language of an individual has an influence on cognitive processes. If indeed the level of FTR mandated by a language can profoundly influence the activities of its speakers, it would be far more informative to include English with the Romance languages rather than draw the distinction at inflected verbs as Aarts and Chrystal have done.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">5.1 </span><span class="c1">In conclusion it appears that considering languages&rsquo; approach toward marking tense in rigid forms, using Latin as an arbitrary standard, gives rise to much debate and a deeper understanding of language as a result. However, since placing languages in discrete categories with regards to tense is not only problematic but also provides no advantage. Aarts&rsquo; FTR spectrum would appear to be a more illuminating method of approaching this issue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"><br>From a practical standpoint, it seems that for the purposes of language instruction, it would not be necessary to insist that English possesses a future tense, if it is not deemed helpful to do so. Whether or not the usage can be considered as modal or not, the forms used to express future events in English are identical to modal verbs and teachers can feel justified in teaching them as such.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c9">Bibliography</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aarts, B., 1961-.
