              <p>After becoming frustrated with a repetitive task in Excel at work one day, I decided that there must be an easier way. I stumbled across VBA and was hooked.</p>
              <p>Since then I have been known as the Excel wizard in several offices. This has allowed me to automate many processes, saving time and money for colleagues and myself.</p>
              <p>I'm still studying and acquiring more skills. This website was 100% made by me using the skills that I learned through the FreeCodeCamp course.</p>
              <p>So far, I have a good understanding of the following technologies:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>HTML5</li>
                <li>CSS3 - Bootstrap, Materialize</li>
                <li>Javascript - JQuery</li>
                <li>Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>My next project is to learn more about back-end web development and SQL.</p>

              <h5>Public speaking</h5>
              <p>Speaking in front of classes of up to 35 students on a regular basis forced me to learn how to transmit information clearly. After giving speeched in assembly to 700 students in Japanese and being interviewed on <a id="link" href"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stuUa6SePPU">Japanese TV</a>, I have no fear of speaking in front of large groups.</p>
              <h5>Intercultural communication</h5>
              <p>Apart from my language abilities discussed elsewhere, living and working in a variety of cultures has exposed me to people from many different backgrounds. This has allowed me to develop a tolerant attitude and to reexamine some of my own preconceptions.</p>
              <h5>Flexibility</h5>
              <p>As my work history attests, I have experience of working in many places and in widely varying roles. I have been able to thrive in all of these.</p><p>On several occasions I have moved to a new country with very few to no contacts. In each instance I created a successful life for myself.</p><p>I enjoy the challenge of being outside of my comfort zone and the opportunities for learning that this presents.</p>
              <h5>Organisation</h5>
              <p>Moving from country to country and dealing with the paperwork involved necessitates organisation. I have gained these skills from planning classes for students across 3 schools in Japan and maintaining contact with international agents as an International Officer at Anglia Ruskin University.</p>

            <p>Related to travelling is my love of language learning. This is something that I discovered early on and it's opened many doors for me. While nobody would suggest that learning a new language is easy, the satisfaction that comes from finally being able to use it to communicate is incomparable. This is why I take so much pleasure from teaching. It's great to help students in this process.</p>
            <p>Over the past couple of years, I've found myself drawn more and more to developing my programming skills. As with languages, it's a frustrating process but the reward comes when a concept finally 'clicks'.</p>
            <p>Aside from the above, I try to stay in shape. I enjoy going to the gym and as a result, I spend a lot of my time cooking. Contact me for recipies!</p></div>
